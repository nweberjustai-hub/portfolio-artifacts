# Portfolio Artifacts

This repository contains a curated selection of academic and non-academic work samples demonstrating analytical thinking, data wrangling, reporting, and professional documentation practices in regulated and operational environments.

The materials here are intentionally scoped, sanitized, and contextualized. They are shared to illustrate *how I work* within defined constraints, requirements, and governance boundaries—rather than to showcase experimental or unconstrained projects.

## Contents Overview

### Academic Samples
Doctoral-level writing and analytical work produced within formal coursework, shared as representative examples of research framing, structured analysis, and the ability to incorporate expert feedback.

- Emphasis on methodology, decision support, and domain-aware reasoning  
- Fixed requirements and datasets, reflecting real-world constraints  
- Instructor feedback included where appropriate (redacted for privacy)

### Analytics & Reporting Projects
Selected projects demonstrating practical data analysis and reporting workflows using commonly adopted enterprise tools.

- Power BI dashboards and reporting examples  
- Excel-based data wrangling and modeling patterns  
- Python-based end-to-end analysis (data preparation, modeling, visualization)

These projects emphasize clarity, explainability, and usability over novelty.

### Selected Writing & Guidance
Examples of professional writing and internal-style guidance developed for regulated, public-sector, or enterprise Microsoft 365 environments.

- Governance-aware documentation  
- Risk-sensitive guidance  
- Written communication for technical and non-technical stakeholders  

These materials are included as background writing samples, not as proposed solutions for any specific organization.

## Scope & Constraints

Across all artifacts, the following principles apply:

- Work was completed using **provided or mandated datasets and requirements**
- No proprietary, confidential, or internal operational data is included
- Projects prioritize **accuracy, defensibility, and operational realism**
- Tooling choices reflect what is commonly available in enterprise environments

This mirrors how most real-world analytics, reporting, and project work is actually performed.

## Notes for Reviewers

If you are reviewing this repository in the context of an interview or professional discussion, individual folders contain short READMEs explaining context, constraints, and intent. I am happy to walk through any artifact at a high level and discuss tradeoffs, assumptions, or extensions as appropriate.
