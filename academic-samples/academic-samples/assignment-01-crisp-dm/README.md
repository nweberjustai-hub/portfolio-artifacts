## CRISP-DM Application: Predictive Maintenance in Electric Utilities

**Context**  
This paper was written as part of a doctoral-level data science course and is shared here as a writing and analytical sample.

**Purpose**  
The work demonstrates how the CRISP-DM framework can be applied to a regulated, asset-intensive domain (electric utility protection systems), with emphasis on decision support, interpretability, and alignment with engineering judgment.

**Constraints**  
- Fixed assignment scope and requirements  
- No access to real operational data  
- Focus on conceptual modeling and workflow design rather than implementation  

These constraints intentionally mirror real-world environments where analysts and project managers must work within defined inputs and governance boundaries.

**Artifacts**
- Final paper (PDF)
- Instructor feedback (redacted, PDF)

**Note**  
This sample is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect proprietary systems, data, or internal practices of any specific utility.
